Simple Content Management System

HOW IT WORKS?

The app allows user to:

    • Display, create, edit, delete Categories,
    • Display, create, edit, delete Authors,
    • Display, create, edit, delete Articles,
    • Save articles as drafts, display the list of drafts.
    
It contains both DAO classes and repositories (but actually only the repositories are in use).
